# NightOwl
A realÂ­time, wearable, nighttime seizure notification and reporting system.

Effective treatment of epilepsy requires accurate reporting of occurrences of seizures and duration of seizures. Oftentimes the data available is inaccurate because of natural inefficiencies in caregivers. NightOwl addresses this problem by creating an always-on system that detects and monitors seizure activity.
